    <p>Achar Gosht is an authentic Pakistani recipe. To translate exactly Achar is Pickle and Gosht is Red Meat. So basically meat is cooked in spices that are used in traditional pickle. Addition of these particular spices give this curry an earthy flavour and its very aromatic.
        Its an delicious, mildly spicy and comforting curry like Aloo Gosht (Meat Gravy with Potatoes) and Lamb Rogan Josh</p>
