    <h1>ALO GOSHT</h1>

    <img src="../images/alo gosht.jpg" alt="">

    <p>I’m extremely sentimental about the shorba in Aloo Gosht (and most shorba curries, actually). It needs to be absolutely perfect – no big chunks of onion floating around, no thick and gloopy shorba, none of that flavourless soup that looks like boiled water. Nope, I’m not having any of it! (Psssst! I have lots of shorba tips on my Aloo Anday post)</p>
