        After much trial and error, I introduce to you the Best Mutton Biryani recipe you're likely to taste. Succulent goat meat is cooked with a homemade spice blend to make
         a delicious curry. This is layered with the best quality Sella rice and infused with aromatic saffron, kewra, and rose water. This recipe will take you back in time and
          make you feel as if you're seated at the royal table in the famed Mughal court. 
        This biryani recipe is an old family one, just like my gosht aloo Bukhara, my Nihari recipe, and my tawa fry beef keema.
