   <h1>PEAS BIRYANI</h1>
   <img src="../images/peas.jpg" alt=""> 

   <p>Matar Pulao â€“ we have here a much loved pair. Comfort food at potentially its purest and most wholesome. Something the kids (usually, depending on their mood) love. Economical. Quick and easy to prepare. Just generally an all-round winner.</p>
