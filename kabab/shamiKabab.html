    <h1>SHAMI KABAB</h1>

    <pShami Kebabs have always been my best bud, helping me out through tough times. Most notably was through the final months of my most recent pregnancy â€“ I made a batch of about 50 Shami Kebabs for the freezer at around 7 months and they saw us through till I gave birth. It was an absolute life saver because I was in and out of the hospital every other day for the rest of that pregnancy!></p>
