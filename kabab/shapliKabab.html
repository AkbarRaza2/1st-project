    <h1>SHAPLI KABAB</h1>

    <img src="../images/shahi.jpg" alt="">

    <p>This Chapli Kabab recipe is a very special one for me. It was gifted to me in the form of a handwritten note by my Afghanistani neighbour, a lady who couldnâ€™t speak English but had her son translate all the ingredients, quantities and instructions for me when I asked for her recipe. She laughed and looked to the floor in embarrassment when I thanked her profusely for going through all that effort for me.</p>
