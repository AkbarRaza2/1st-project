    <h1>WHITE KARHAI</h1>

    <img src="../images/white karhai.jpg" alt="">

    <p> karahi is a Pakistani Dhaba (roadside restaurant) food. It is a white-colored tomato-free version of traditional red karahi. It is enriched with yogurt and cream. The recipe evolved in the hands of restaurant cooks.

    This White Chicken Karahi recipe is an amazing day-saver and even a face-saver. When you have no time to cook or you have unexpected guests or you have been out the whole day and you donâ€™t want to order food because you want home-cooked food.</p>
