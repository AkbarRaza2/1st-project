    <h1>DALL MOONG</h1>

    <img src="../images/moong.jpg" alt="">

    <p>Moong Dal recipe is a delicious, healthy and protein rich dish made from hulled and split mung beans or yellow moong lentils. Here I share two different recipes that feature tasty lentils: Moong Dal Tadka, with flavorful seasonings tempered in hot oil or ghee, and Moong Dal Fry, which includes lightly saut√©ing aromatics before mixing with the cooked yellow mung lentils. Both methods are easy to prepare with my step-by-step instructions and photos, and create incredibly savory, satisfying lentil dishes!</p>
